They have dense fur (the densest of any animal on earth!) to keep them warm and to increase buoyancy. They are adept at using tools, such as rocks, to crack open their meals, like shellfish and sea urchins. These social creatures are found along the coasts of the North Pacific Ocean, where they play a vital role in maintaining the health of kelp forests by keeping sea urchin populations in check.

With their large eyes and sleek bodies, they are well-adapted to life in water (though their method of galumphing on land may seem a bit more silly). Harbo are often seen basking on rocks, beaches, or floating effortlessly on ocean waves. Though they are found along most of the Northern Hemisphere, the subspecies most commonly seen in Monterey Bay is the pacific harbor seal.
